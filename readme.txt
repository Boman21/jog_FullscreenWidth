jogFullscreenWidth adds a input field to change the editarea width, next to the toolbar buttons at the fullscreen view.

== Description ==

The jogFullscreenWidth WordPress Plugin is a very simple Plugin, that adds an input field to change the title and editarea width, next to the toolbar buttons at the fullscreen view.

The standard width of the WordPress editarea is at this time 824px. For some reasons this was to small for me. jogFullscreenWidth let you change the desired width on the fly by simply type the width in pixel into the input box. Afer you click elsewhere on the screen the width of the title and editarea will be changed.

Note: The width is set as long you donâ€™t reload the browser.

== Installation ==

1. Install easily with the WordPress plugin control panel or manually download the plugin and upload the folder `jog_FullscreenWidth` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory 
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it.  You're ready to go! Test it in your fullscreen edit window
